# LTL = LiveTheLife.TV

LiveTheLifeTV is a L3 blockchain built on OP Stack with Celestia as DA focusing on the NFT ecosystem.

From the first NFT standard of ERC721 introduced by the Ethereum community in 2017 to the present day, NFTs have been developed for 6 years. 

Our mission is to promote innovation in NFT protocols and enhance NFT asset development efficiency. The core value of the LTL blockchain lies in promoting and driving innovation in NFT standards, guiding developers to innovate and explore NFT assets in more real-world applications , including but not limited to AIGC, RWA, reputation systems, membership systems, identity systems, entertainment industry, sports industry, multimedia, and other fields. The vision of the LTL blockchain is to create a decentralized network where anyone can freely participate in creating NFT asset protocol standards and issuing NFT assets , better promoting innovation in NFT asset protocols, expanding NFT asset application scenarios, and improving the efficiency of NFT asset issuance.

# Features

## Lower Gas Fee
## Native NFT infrastructure
## Revenue Sharing with Devs

LTL Blockchain uses Celestia as the DA (Data Availability) layer to significantly reduce transaction costs for users. LTL is built on the OP Stack, which is designed from the ground up to be as close to Ethereum as possible. Because of this, there are very little differences when it comes to building on LTL and Ethereum. Developers engaged in innovative endeavors on the LTL blockchain will receive a substantial share of the gas fee revenue generated, providing a direct and significant incentive. LTL can be added as a custom network to any EVM-compatible wallet
